    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Samantha Considine, but I usually go by Sam. I have lived in southern New Jersey my whole
        life and currently reside in Runnemede. I work at the University of Penn as an Audiovisual Technician in Wharton
        Computing.</p>
    <p>I am an avid Philadelphia sports fan and especially love the Eagles and the Flyers. I like to cook in my spare
        time and have two cats named Pickle and Beans.</p>
